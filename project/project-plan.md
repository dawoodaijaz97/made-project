# Project Plan

## Title
Data Exploration and Risk Assessment of Vehicle Collisions in NYC

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What are the primary factors contributing to motor vehicle collisions in New York City?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
### Project Description:

My aims to analyze New York City's "Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes" dataset to uncover patterns and factors contributing to traffic accidents. The primary motivation is to understand where and why collisions occur.

### Why I Attempt It:

New York City has a high volume of traffic and pedestrian activity, making road safety a critical concern. By delving into this dataset, I hope to identify high-risk areas and the most common contributing factors to collisions, such as driver inattention, speeding, or environmental conditions.

### How I Attempt It:

The project will begin with data cleaning and preprocessing data for example handle missing values and ensure accuracy. I will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine temporal patterns (e.g., time of day, day of the week) and spatial patterns using geospatial mapping to identify collision hotspots. I will use Python to do my project.  Statistical methods will be applied to determine the significance of various factors influencing collisions. Finally, the results will be visualized through dashboards, making the findings accessible for stakeholders to drive informed decision-making.
